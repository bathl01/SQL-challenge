# SQL-challenge
Module 9 Challenge
# Background
A research project about people whom Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
# Objectives
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. Whuich include designing the tables using QuickDBD that will hold the CSV data, using pgAdmin to create the tables, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer a series of questions about the data.
